Pushing to Arrays

I wanted to create a memory game using flags.

The idea being that the player would need to memorise where the flags are on the screen and then have a set amount of time to find them.

Using click events on the intial pages, I was able to create a starter page and an instructions page.
Once the player clicks through, the flags are displayed using dynamic JavaScript and then hidden after a set time.

The player then finds the flags and on each click, this info is pushed to array which targets. an array of objects with a country/image/fact.

This information is then used to display a message when the play finds a match, displaying the country/flag and an interesting (?!) fact including their name too for added personalisation.

Once the player finds all the pairs, it displays a personalised winning message.
If they do not find all the pairs before 0 seconds, it displays a game over message with a restart button.
All game messages were created using dynamic JavaScript to access the array of objects Country data.

Several timers were used and display styling to show and hide the flags at the approrpiate times.
